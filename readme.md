Conducting historical research, one often encounters odd currencies, measures, and calendars, all of which are bound to space and time. Calender conversion tools can be readily found on the internet (a good example is [CalendarHome](http://www.calendarhome.com/converter/)'s adaptation of [Fourmilab](http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/)'s code), but converters for non-metric currencies and weights are a bit trickier to come by. As I found myself repeatedly computing exchange rates between Ottoman Lira, British Pound Sterling, US Dollars, and French Francs, I wrote a simple javascript and html frontend.

<!-- The javascript is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tillgrallert/historical-currency-converter). --> Check [my blog](http://tillgrallert.github.io/2013/05/04/historical-currency-converter.html) to look at a functional implementation.
